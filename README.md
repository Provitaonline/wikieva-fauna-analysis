# wikieva-fauna-analysis

This repo contains scripts used to match the content of Wikieva against Fauna (Libro Rojo de la Fauna Venezolana)

The ```rescue-wikieva``` and ```rescue-fauna``` directories need to be siblings directory to the ```wikieva-fauna-analysis``` directory (this repo).

More scripts will be added as needed.
